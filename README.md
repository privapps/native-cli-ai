`nca` is a Rust-native, terminal-first general-purpose AI assistant that ships as a single binary. It supports research, writing, planning, analysis, coding, and tool-driven workflows through an interactive TUI, line REPL, one-shot runs, detached sessions, attach/status/logs, JSON and NDJSON output, Unix-socket IPC, worktree-isolated subagents, and autonomous research helpers.

It is meant for people who like their AI tooling close to the terminal: fast to start, easy to script, and capable of running real session workflows without dragging in a browser shell.

The product surface is the CLI. No desktop wrapper, no Electron, no browser in the default path.

## What's New in 0.4

- **Dedicated `nca-tui` crate** — full-screen transcript, overlays, sidebar, and REPL live in their own crate; `nca-cli` stays the thin entrypoint.
- **Unified product home** — sessions, memory, and CLI index land under `$NCA_HOME` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ncacli` / `~/.local/share/ncacli` (legacy `~/.nca` still migrates).
- **Live busy activity** — status bar and transcript footer show thinking / streaming / tool path with elapsed time so long model waits never look stuck.
- **Soft provider retries** — empty-response retries stay in thinking state instead of flipping to a red error mid-turn.
- **Tool path previews** — in-flight `write_file` / `edit_file` / bash calls show the path or command one-liner.
- **Multi-OS releases** — GitHub Releases build Linux, macOS, and Windows (x86_64 + ARM where available).

## What It Does

- Runs tasks in an interactive TUI or a line-oriented REPL.
- Keeps slash commands, the command palette, and `/help` in sync via one registry (palette Enter runs the command).
- Supports one-shot runs and detached background sessions.
- Persists session state and event logs under the current workspace.
- Exposes machine-readable JSON and NDJSON for automation.
- Spawns child agents with explicit parent/child lineage and optional git worktrees.
- Uses MiniMax by default, with OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and custom endpoint support.
- Loads built-in tools plus optional MCP tools from config.
- Sends **native multimodal** (text + image) messages to MiniMax and other vision-capable models.
- Auto-summarizes long conversations to prevent token overflow.
- Discovers skills from `AGENTS.md` sections, filesystem directories, and user-level skill directories.
- Builds a cached CLI index for workspace-aware agent context.

## Why People Reach For It

- You want a terminal AI assistant that feels quick and stays out of the way.
- You want sessions, event logs, and resumable work instead of a throwaway prompt box.
- You want child agents that can branch off cleanly with lineage and optional git worktrees.
- You want a CLI that still works well when another system is driving it through JSON, NDJSON, and IPC.
- You want intelligent context management that auto-summarizes without losing important context.

## Common Use Cases

| Use case | Why `nca` fits |
|---|---|
| Solo coding in the terminal | Start with `nca`, use the TUI, switch agent profiles, review diffs, and keep everything in one terminal-native flow. |
| Quick one-shot work | `nca run --prompt ...` gives you a focused foreground task without opening a longer session than you need. |
| Background analysis | `nca spawn --prompt ...` lets you kick off work, keep coding, then come back with `status`, `logs`, or `attach`. |
| Multi-agent exploration | Parent and child sessions keep lineage, and child runs can use separate git worktrees for isolation. |
| Automation and orchestration | `--json`, `--stream ndjson`, Unix-socket IPC, and `NCA_ORCH_*` metadata make it usable as a worker process. |
| Long-running research | `nca autoresearch once` runs metric-driven experiments with parsed output for CI/profiling. |

## Installation

### One-line install (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nca-cli.com/install | bash
```

This detects your platform, downloads the latest release from GitHub, and installs `nca` to `/usr/local/bin`. Set `NCA_INSTALL_DIR` to change the install path.

Windows: download the matching `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/madebyaris/native-cli-ai/releases) and put `nca.exe` on your `PATH`.

### GitHub Releases

Pre-built binaries for every release are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/madebyaris/native-cli-ai/releases) page:

| Platform | Target | Archive |
|---|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `.tar.gz` |
| macOS (Intel) | `x86_64-apple-darwin` | `.tar.gz` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `.tar.gz` |
| Linux (ARM64) | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `.tar.gz` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `.zip` |

### Build from source

Requires Rust edition 2024 (use a recent toolchain).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madebyaris/native-cli-ai.git
cd native-cli-ai
cargo build --release
cp target/release/nca /usr/local/bin/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Configure a provider
export MINIMAX_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Start the interactive CLI
nca

# Line REPL instead of the full-screen TUI
nca --no-tui

# Run one task and exit
nca run --prompt "Explain this repository"

# Spawn a detached session
nca spawn --prompt "Inspect the repo and draft a plan"

# Inspect and attach
nca sessions
nca status <session_id>
nca attach <session_id>
```

The full-screen UI appears when `stdin` and `stdout` are TTYs and `--stream human` is active. Otherwise `nca` falls back to the line-oriented REPL or one-shot execution path.

### Images (full-screen TUI)

In the default TUI you can attach images for the **next** user message:

- **Ctrl+V** — paste a bitmap from the system clipboard (saved as PNG under the session).
- **`/image paste`** — same as clipboard paste if Ctrl+V is not available.
- **`/image path/to/screenshot.png`** — copy a file into the session attachment dir.
- **`/image clear`** — remove staged images before you press Enter.

For **MiniMax**, pasted images are analyzed with the same HTTP API as the MCP's `understand_image` tool (`POST /v1/coding_plan/vlm` on `https://api.minimax.io` or your region host); nca does this in Rust (no Python MCP). The description is merged into the user message before `/v1/messages`. Other providers use their own multimodal chat formats where supported. If the **selected provider/model is not treated as vision-capable**, `nca` **errors** instead of silently dropping images. Session attachment copies are removed automatically after a successful send/process; your original source file is not deleted.

## A Quick Look

The main interface is designed to feel like a serious terminal tool, not a toy overlay.

## Core Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nca` | Start the default interactive experience. Auto-resumes the last session unless `--no-resume` is used. |
| `nca run --prompt ...` | Run one task in the foreground. |
| `nca spawn --prompt ...` | Start a detached session and return immediately. |
| `nca resume <session_id>` | Resume a saved session. |
| `nca attach <session_id>` | Attach to a running session over IPC. |
| `nca logs <session_id>` | Read or follow the event log. |
| `nca status <session_id>` | Show session status and metadata. |
| `nca cancel <session_id>` | Mark a detached session as cancelled. |
| `nca sessions` | List saved sessions, with filters like `--status`, `--since-hours`, and `--search`. |
| `nca models` | Show configured models and provider-facing defaults. |
| `nca doctor` | Check provider readiness, skills, and memory/config paths. |
| `nca config` | Print effective config and resolved paths. |
| `nca memory list\|add` | Inspect or append workspace memory notes. |
| `nca skills` | List discovered skills with their source (`AGENTS.md`, filesystem, or user directory). |
| `nca mcp` | List configured MCP servers. |
| `nca completion <shell>` | Generate shell completions. |
| `nca index build\|show` | Build or inspect a cached CLI index under `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<workspace-id>/`. |
| `nca autoresearch once <program.md>` | Run a metric-driven research program and print parsed output. |

There is also a hidden `serve` subcommand used for IPC-oriented service sessions.

## Interactive UX

The interactive surface has two modes:

- **Full-screen TUI** — transcript (markdown + syntax highlighting), composer, overlays (palette, pickers, connect wizard), approvals, structured questions, session sidebar, and branch chip.
- **Line-oriented REPL** (`reedline`) — for scripts, non-TTY environments, or `--no-tui`.

Slash commands, the Ctrl+P command palette, autocomplete, and `/help` all come from one registry, so labels stay in sync. Palette **Enter executes** the command (it does not only pre-fill the composer).

### Slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show help (generated from the registry). |
| `/agent` | Choose agent profile (`build`, `plan`, `review`, `fix`, `test`). |
| `/plan` `/review` `/fix` `/test` | Run a preset turn for that profile. |
| `/skills` | Browse discovered skills; `/{skill}` runs one. |
| `/memory` | Show or append memory notes. |
| `/compact` | Compact session context. |
| `/copy` | Copy the latest assistant response (TUI; also `Ctrl+Shift+C`). |
| `/todos` | Show the session todo list. |
| `/model` | Open the model picker (`/models` is an alias). |
| `/reasoning-effort` | Show or persist OpenAI-compatible Chat/Responses reasoning effort. |
| `/connect` | Connect / switch provider, API key, or custom endpoint; use `/provider`, `/apikey`, or `/custom` for related setup commands. |
| `/status` | Session status and health (`/stats`, `/cost`, `/doctor` are aliases). |
| `/config` | Config and editor settings (`/settings`, `/set-editor` are aliases). |
| `/permissions` | Permission mode picker (`/permission-bypass` is an alias). |
| `/sessions` `/new` `/export` `/attach` `/logs` | Session lifecycle and inspection. |
| `/image` | Stage clipboard or file images (TUI). |
| `/editor` | Open the external editor. |
| `/mcp` `/agents` `/diff` `/thinking` `/stop` `/clear` `/exit` | System and turn controls. |
| `/auto-answer` | Accept the suggested answer for a pending `ask_question`. |

### Keyboard shortcuts (TUI)

| Binding | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+P` | Open the command palette (fuzzy; Enter runs). |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste image from clipboard (TUI). |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy last assistant response (TUI). |
| `Ctrl+X` then `m` / `e` / `l` / `n` / `c` / `s` / `a` / `h` / `q` | Leader shortcuts: model, editor, sessions, new, compact, status, agent, help, exit. |
| `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+U` | Approve / deny / always-allow a pending tool (wins over an open question modal). |
| `Tab` | Complete `@` path or `/` command; otherwise cycle agent profile. |
| `F2` / `Shift+F2` | Cycle recent models. |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste clipboard image (off the UI thread). |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear the transcript (same idea as `/clear`). |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl+C` | Cancel the current turn when busy. |
| `! <cmd>` | Run a shell command. |
| `@ <path>` | File mention with fuzzy completion (indexes in the background on open). |

Click the branch chip in the status line to open the branch picker (list/switch/create via background git).

While the agent is working, the status bar shows an animated busy state with elapsed seconds (`thinking 12s`, `tool 3s`) and a short detail (model wait, stream size, or file path). The transcript footer mirrors the same live activity so long provider waits do not look frozen.

## Output and Automation

`nca` is designed to work well in two very different moods: terminal-first for humans, and machine-friendly for orchestrators.

- `--stream off` returns only the final output.
- `--stream human` renders the normal terminal experience.
- `--stream ndjson` emits newline-delimited event envelopes.
- `--json` is available on lifecycle-oriented commands such as `spawn`, `sessions`, `status`, `cancel`, `skills`, `models`, `doctor`, `config`, `index show`, and `mcp`.
- `NCA_ORCH_*` and `NCA_ORCH_META_*` environment variables attach orchestration metadata to sessions and harness context.

See [Orchestration Contract](docs/orchestration.md) for the subprocess-facing surface.

## Storage and Paths

`nca` keeps project instructions and git worktrees in the workspace, and stores session/memory/cache data under a unified product home (`$NCA_HOME`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ncacli`, or `~/.local/share/ncacli/`).

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/config.toml` | Global config file (legacy `~/.nca/config.toml` is still read if present). |
| `<workspace>/.nca/config.local.toml` | Workspace-local config overrides. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<id>/sessions/<sid>.json` | Saved session state. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<id>/sessions/<sid>.events.jsonl` | Event log for the session. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<id>/memory.json` | Default memory store. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<id>/last_session` | Auto-resume pointer. |
| `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` | Repo-local instruction layer; each `## Heading` is also a discoverable skill. |
| `<workspace>/.nca/skills/` | Default workspace skill directory. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/skills/` | User-level skill directory (legacy `~/.nca/skills/` still discovered). |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Imported Claude-style skill directory, if present. |
| `<repo>/.nca/worktrees/<session-id>` | Worktree path for isolated child sessions. |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nca/<session_id>.sock` | Unix IPC socket when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set. |
| `/tmp/nca/<session_id>.sock` | Unix IPC socket fallback when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is not set. |
| `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral-port>` | Windows loopback TCP IPC endpoint, persisted in session metadata. |
| `~/.local/share/ncacli/workspaces/<id>/cli-index.json` | Cached CLI index for agents and tooling. |
| `.ncarc` | Project instructions file committed with the repo. |
| `.nca/instructions.md` | Local instructions file. |

## Skills System

`nca` discovers skills from multiple sources with visible provenance:

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — Each root-level `## Heading` becomes a slash-invokable skill. Optional directive bullets can set `model=...`, `permission_mode=...`, and `context=...`.
2. **Filesystem directories** — Skills from `.nca/skills/`, `~/.nca/skills/`, and `~/.claude/skills/`.
3. **Built-in skills** — Core skills baked into the binary.

Use `nca skills --json` to see all discovered skills with their sources.

## Context Management

`nca` automatically manages conversation context to prevent token overflow:

- **Token estimation** uses character-based approximation (chars / 4, with tool-message adjustments).
- **Auto-summarize** kicks in when context reaches a configurable threshold (default 75%).
- **Summary format** preserves key topics, decisions, and critical context.
- System messages are always preserved; recent messages use a sliding window.
- **Smart compaction** (opt-in) builds a deterministic provider-request view that truncates older read/search noise while keeping tool groups atomic. Canonical session history is never rewritten by this path.

Configuration in `~/.local/share/ncacli/config.toml`:

```toml
[memory.context]
context_window_target = 0          # 0 = auto-detect
max_retained_messages = 50
auto_summarize_threshold = 75
enable_auto_summarize = true
smart_compaction_mode = "off"      # off | dry_run | on
```

Use `dry_run` first to inspect savings under `/status` and in the human stream before enabling `on`.

## Providers

MiniMax is the default provider path. The codebase also supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter, so the project can stay MiniMax-first without boxing itself into one provider forever.

Typical environment variables:

- `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `CUSTOM_PROVIDER_API_KEY` (for custom endpoints)

### Custom Endpoints

Use `/connect` in the TUI (or the command palette) and choose **Custom** to configure the single custom-provider slot. The slot supports OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic-compatible endpoints. In an existing session, `/provider` → **Add custom provider…** opens the add/edit wizard, while `/provider custom` activates the configured slot. The `/custom` command remains available for scripts and existing configurations.

```
/connect
```

See [Providers](docs/documentation/providers.md) for full details.

Provider config is loaded from defaults, then `~/.local/share/ncacli/config.toml`, then `<workspace>/.nca/config.local.toml`, then environment overrides.

Use `nca doctor` to verify provider readiness and `nca models` to inspect model selection.

## Harness and Tooling

The system prompt is layered in this order:

1. Built-in harness prompt
2. Permission-mode guidance
3. Project guidance from `AGENTS.md` (full file as instructions)
4. Project instructions from `.ncarc`
5. Local instructions from `.nca/instructions.md`
6. Discovered skills summary
7. Orchestration context

The built-in tool surface includes filesystem editing, search, diffing, patching, shell execution, web access, `ask_question`, and `spawn_subagent`. MCP tools are loaded dynamically when configured, so the available tool set can grow with your environment.

### Search And Edit Tools

Recent search/edit improvements are aimed at making agent file work less brittle:

- `search_code` now returns structured JSON match objects instead of raw `rg` text.
- `search_code` treats ripgrep exit code `1` as a successful empty result, not a failure.
- `search_code` supports `path`, `glob`, `fixed_strings`, `case_sensitive`, `word`, `context_before`, `context_after`, and `max_results`.
- `query_symbols` is a literal Rust symbol lookup, not an implicit regex expansion of user input.
- `edit_file` and `apply_patch` now fail loudly on ambiguous single-match edits instead of silently changing the first occurrence.
- `replace_match` can edit a specific search result by exact `path`, `line`, and `column`, which makes search -> edit flows much safer.

## Crate Layout

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `crates/common` | Shared config, events, sessions, messages, tool schemas, and orchestration metadata. |
| `crates/core` | Agent loop, provider abstraction, harness builder, skills, approvals, and tool registry. |
| `crates/runtime` | Session supervision, IPC, persistence, worktrees, memory store, context management, and subagent execution. |
| `crates/tui` | Full-screen TUI, line REPL, slash-command registry, overlays, transcript rendering, and session UI state. |
| `crates/cli` | `nca` binary entrypoint, clap commands, stream rendering, and glue onto `nca-tui` / runtime. |
| `crates/autoresearch` | Metric-driven autonomous research helpers and experiment runner. |

The shipped app is still a **single binary** (`nca`). The TUI crate owns interactive presentation; the CLI crate owns argument parsing and lifecycle commands.

## Session Model

- Sessions are persisted as JSON snapshots plus JSONL event logs.
- The runtime uses a `Supervisor` to own lifecycle, IPC, approvals, questions, event fanout, and persistence.
- Child sessions can inherit parent context, record lineage in session metadata, and run inside separate git worktrees.
- IPC uses newline-delimited JSON over Unix sockets or Windows loopback TCP so `attach`, approvals,
  status, and other controls share one runtime transport. Clients treat the persisted endpoint as
  opaque data and never derive a Windows port from the session ID.
- `ContextManager` tracks token usage and auto-summarizes long conversations.

In practice, that means you can start small, branch out when a task gets bigger, and still keep a clean trail of what happened.

## Funding

`nca` is an independent project built by [Aris Setia](https://github.com/madebyaris). It is not backed by a company and is not powered by any single provider — the multi-provider architecture is intentional so users can choose what works for them.

MiniMax has supported this work through content collaboration and developer events in Indonesia, which helped make the early development possible. Sustaining full-time work on the Rust-native AI ecosystem requires ongoing support.

If you find `nca` useful and want to help keep it going:
