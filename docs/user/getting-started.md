# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (edition 2024, stable channel)
- **Git** — required for session worktrees and version control integration
- **ripgrep (`rg`)** — used by the `search_code` tool for fast code search
- **An LLM API key** — MiniMax (default), Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or any compatible endpoint

## Installation

### One-line install (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nca-cli.com/install | bash
```

### GitHub Releases

Pre-built binaries ship for Linux, macOS, and Windows (x86_64 and ARM64). Grab the matching archive from [Releases](https://github.com/madebyaris/native-cli-ai/releases).

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madebyaris/native-cli-ai.git
cd native-cli-ai

# Build optimized release binary
cargo build --release

# Install to your PATH (Unix)
cp target/release/nca /usr/local/bin/
```

The release profile is optimized for size and speed (`opt-level = 3`, `lto = "thin"`, `strip = true`).

### Verify Installation

```bash
nca doctor
```

This runs configuration checks and reports any issues with your setup.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Set an API Key

The fastest way to get started is to export your API key:

```bash
# MiniMax (default provider)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Or use another provider
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

To persist the key, add it to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) or store it in the config file:

```toml
# ~/.local/share/ncacli/config.toml  (or $NCA_HOME/config.toml)
[provider.minimax]
api_key = "your-key-here"
```

Legacy `~/.nca/config.toml` is still read if the product-home config is missing.

### 2. First Run

Navigate to any project directory and launch nca:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
nca
```

On first launch, nca runs an **onboarding flow** that helps you:
- Select your default LLM provider
- Enter your API key
- Confirm basic settings

After onboarding, you enter the interactive TUI where you can start chatting with the agent.

### 3. One-Shot Mode

For quick tasks without entering the interactive session:

```bash
nca -p "explain the architecture of this project"
nca -p "add a health check endpoint to the API"
```

## Directory Structure

nca creates project-local files under `.nca/` for instructions, skills, and git worktrees. Session history, memory, and last-session pointers live under the product home (`$NCA_HOME`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ncacli`, or `~/.local/share/ncacli/`):

```
~/.local/share/ncacli/
├── config.toml
└── workspaces/<slug>-<16hex>/
    ├── sessions/             # Session state and event logs
    ├── memory.json
    ├── last_session
    └── workspace.json

my-project/
├── .nca/
│   ├── config.local.toml    # Workspace-specific config overrides
│   ├── instructions.md      # Local instructions for the agent
│   ├── worktrees/            # Git worktrees for sub-agents
│   └── skills/               # Local skill definitions
├── .ncarc                    # Project-level instructions
├── AGENTS.md                 # Agent instructions (also used by other AI tools)
└── ...
```

Global config lives at `~/.local/share/ncacli/config.toml`.

## Custom Instructions

You can guide the agent's behavior with instruction files, loaded in this order:

1. **Built-in system prompt** — nca's default behavior rules
2. **`AGENTS.md`** — project-level instructions (compatible with other AI tools)
3. **`.ncarc`** — project-level nca-specific instructions
4. **`.nca/instructions.md`** — personal local instructions (gitignored)
5. **Skills** — discovered summaries available for explicit invocation
6. **Orchestration context** — optional `NCA_ORCH_*` metadata for supervised runs

The full non-empty `AGENTS.md` at the configured workspace root is additive: it
does not replace built-in safety guidance, and nca does not implicitly search
parent or nested directories for more instruction files. Root-level `##`
sections may also appear as explicitly invocable skills; see [Skills](./skills.md).

Example `.ncarc`:

```markdown
## Project Context

This is a REST API built with Axum. Use PostgreSQL for data storage.
Always run `cargo test` after making changes.
Prefer the `anyhow` crate for error handling.
```

## Shell Completions

Generate shell completions for your shell:

```bash
# Bash
nca completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/nca

# Zsh
nca completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_nca

# Fish
nca completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/nca.fish
```

## Next Steps

- [Commands](./commands.md) — common CLI workflows
- [CLI Reference](../reference/cli-reference.md) — generated top-level commands and options
- [Interactive Mode](./interactive-mode.md) — TUI features, slash commands, shortcuts
- [Configuration](./configuration.md) — detailed config options
- [Providers](./providers.md) — set up LLM providers
