# Interactive Mode

nca provides a rich interactive experience with a full-screen TUI (Terminal User Interface) and a fallback line-oriented REPL.

## TUI vs REPL

| Mode | When Used | Features |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **TUI** (default) | Terminal is a TTY, `--stream human`, no `--no-tui` | Full-screen, scrollable output, command palette, modals, mouse support |
| **Line REPL** | `--no-tui` flag, or non-TTY stdin/stdout | Simple line-by-line input/output, still supports slash commands |

Force line REPL mode:

```bash
nca --no-tui
```

## Live Busy Activity

While the agent is working, the TUI keeps progress visible so long model waits do not look stuck:

| Busy state | What you see |
|------------|--------------|
| **thinking** | Animated spinner + elapsed seconds (`thinking 12s`) and a transcript footer like `waiting for model · 12s` |
| **streaming** | Stream progress with character count |
| **tool** | Tool name plus a one-liner (file path for `write_file` / `edit_file`, command for `execute_bash`) |
| **approval** | Waiting for y/n or Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+N / Ctrl+U |

Empty provider responses that are still retrying stay in **thinking** (soft retry), instead of flipping the status bar to a hard error mid-turn. The sidebar `status` field mirrors the same busy label.

## Input Modes

### Regular Text

Type your message and press **Enter** to send it to the agent.

### Shell Commands (`!`)

Prefix with `!` to run a shell command directly. The output is captured and fed into the conversation context.

```
! cargo test
! git log --oneline -5
! ls -la src/
```

### File Mentions (`@`)

Type `@` followed by a path to inline-reference a file. nca performs fuzzy file search and auto-completion.

```
Can you review @src/main.rs and @src/lib.rs?
```

In the TUI, pressing `@` opens a file picker with fuzzy search. Use `Tab` to navigate matches and `Enter` to select.

### Multiline Input (TUI)

In the full-screen TUI, **Enter** sends the current draft. Use **Shift+Enter**,
**Alt+Enter**, or **Ctrl+J** to insert a newline. Ctrl+J is the reliable
fallback when a terminal or multiplexer does not preserve the Shift modifier
on Enter. Bracketed terminal paste inserts the
whole payload atomically, preserving paragraph breaks while normalizing CRLF
and CR to LF; a trailing newline remains in the draft and never submits it.
The composer grows to eight visible rows and follows the cursor for longer
drafts. Up/Down navigate a non-empty draft, while an empty draft keeps their
transcript-scrolling behavior. Use **Ctrl+X E** for the external editor when
the composition is very long.

The line-oriented REPL retains its backslash continuation behavior:

```
Write a function that \
takes a vector of strings \
and returns the longest one.
```

Bracketed paste is enabled for the line-oriented REPL as well: a pasted
paragraph is one draft, one submitted request, and one prompt-history entry.
Multiline drafts beginning with `/` or `!` are treated as ordinary message
content; single-line slash and shell commands keep their command behavior.
When a terminal or multiplexer does not support bracketed paste, use the
external editor or explicit modified-Enter flow instead of relying on ordinary
Enter events to delimit pasted paragraphs.

### Slash Commands (`/`)

Type `/` to access slash commands. In the TUI, this opens an inline autocomplete menu.

---

## Slash Commands

### General

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show help with all commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/status` | Display session status (ID, model, agent profile, permission mode) |
| `/clear` | Clear the screen |
| `/exit`, `/quit`, `/q` | Exit the session |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/export` | Export the current session to markdown |
| `/stop` | Cancel the current agent turn |

### Agent Profiles

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agent [profile]` | Show or switch agent profile |
| `/plan <task>` | Run a planning-oriented turn (read-only analysis) |
| `/review <task>` | Run a code review turn |
| `/fix <task>` | Run a bug-fix turn |
| `/test <task>` | Run a validation/testing turn |

Available agent profiles:

| Profile | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@build` | Default full-access agent for development work |
| `@plan` | Read-only agent for analysis and planning |
| `@review` | Focused code review agent |
| `@fix` | Bug diagnosis and fix agent |
| `@test` | Testing and validation agent |

### Model and Provider

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/models` | Browse and select models (opens picker in TUI) |
| `/model [name]` | Set the active model for the session |
| `/connect` | Open the provider connection picker |
| `/provider [name]` | Show or set the default LLM provider |

| `/apikey <provider> <key>` | Store an API key for a provider |
| `/reasoning-effort [value]` | Show or persist OpenAI-compatible Chat/Responses reasoning effort |

`/reasoning-effort <value>` trims and saves the value to the workspace
configuration. Use `/reasoning-effort nil` to omit the request property, or
run `/reasoning-effort` without an argument to display the current value and
whether the active provider uses the OpenAI-compatible request shape. Values
such as `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and gateway-specific strings
are passed through unchanged. The setting is not sent to MiniMax, Anthropic,
or an Anthropic-compatible Custom endpoint, and it is not part of the Custom
provider setup wizard.

---

## Command Palette

Press `Ctrl+P` to open the command palette — a searchable list of all available commands. Type to filter, use `↑`/`↓` to navigate, and `Enter` to execute.

## Status Bar

The TUI displays a status bar at the bottom showing:

- Current agent profile
- Active model
- Available shortcuts hint

```
Tab  agent   Ctrl+V  image   Ctrl+Shift+C  copy   Ctrl+P  commands   !cmd  shell   @path  search   /  inline   wheel  scroll
```

## Copying Text

Mouse drag-selection is limited while the TUI owns the terminal. Use:

- `/copy` or `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy the latest assistant response
- Native terminal **Shift+drag** selection as a fallback when you need arbitrary transcript text

## Session Todos

The agent maintains a session checklist through the `update_todos` tool (full-list replacement). The TUI sidebar shows a compact progress view; `/todos` opens the full list (useful on narrow terminals). Todos persist in session JSON and replay via `TodosUpdated` events.

## Image Attachments

In the TUI, paste images from your clipboard with `Ctrl+V` or use the `/image` command. Images are processed through MiniMax native vision and the text description is injected into the conversation.

## Vi Mode

If your `NCA_EDITOR_MODE` environment variable is set to `vi` or `vim`, the REPL uses vi keybindings for line editing.

```bash
export NCA_EDITOR_MODE=vi
```

## External Editor

For composing long messages, use `/editor` to open your configured external editor. The content is sent as your message when you save and close.

Editor resolution order:
1. `NCA_EDITOR` environment variable
2. `[ui].editor` in config
3. `EDITOR` environment variable
4. `vim` (fallback)
